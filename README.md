# Weather-App

A Weather-App web displays real-time weather information for specified locations. It utilizes weather data from APIs like OpenWeatherMap, providing users with current conditions, temperatures, and forecasts. Users input a city, and the app fetches and displays weather data. The app's UI typically includes search functionality and weather details.
